INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(1, 'Zooropa', '1993', 4, 'It''s hard to argue that at this point in their 15-year career U2 is anything but a pre-sold commodity: a critically acclaimed band with massive mainstream appeal. U2''s 1991 album "Achtung Baby" was their most experimental to date, and its sales went through the roof. Consequently, the powers that be at Island/PLG re-signed the Irish quartet to one of the most lucrative contracts in the business, and the company has shipped a mega- healthy 1.6 million copies of U2''s "Zooropa" to US music stores, anticipating the consumer deluge when the disc goes on sale Tuesday.\r\n\r\n"Zooropa" came together quickly -- sort of an unplanned, but not an unwanted, baby. Last year, U2 went in the studio and worked on tracks during a break in their worldwide Zoo TV tour. They realized they had something viable, not just a bunch of out-takes. Recently, lead singer-main lyricist Bono told Rolling Stone that U2 used some leftover bits from the "Achtung Baby" sessions, "but the more interesting stuff came out of improvisation, which was a call of co-producer Brian Eno.\r\n\r\nHail, Eno. It''s in Eno''s nature to explore the outer limits, and, indeed, on the 10-track "Zooropa" U2 is even more out on a limb than they were on ''''Achtung Baby" -- although it''s still recognizable as U2. Despite its quick assemblage, "Zooropa" is no throwaway effort. It''s a creative stretch. Keep in mind that rock''s most enduring artists have always been willing to reinvent themselves at various junctures -- the Beatles with the so-called ''''White Album," the Rolling Stones with "Their Satanic Majesties Request" and David Bowie with "Low," to name but three. U2 is willing to roll those dice.\r\n\r\n"Zooropa" doesn''t have the yearning anthemic reach of days gone by; it doesn''t even have an obvious, slinky pop charm of the last album''s ''''Mysterious Ways." It''s got darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness.\r\n\r\n"Dirty Day," a gently disorienting tune dedicated to barfly-beat poet Charles Bukowski, warns early on, "You can hold onto something so tight/ You''ve already lost it" -- and then launches into a dead-father-to-son discourse about art. "The Wanderer" is a minimalistic, haunting, synth- based, apocalyptically tinged spiritual written by Bono and sung by Johnny Cash. That''s followed by a long pause and, then, an eerie, album-closing coda -- 40 some-odd, treated, staccato guitar bleats.\r\n\r\n"Zooropa" has some semidirect pop gestures, too -- the Bowie-esque, ''''plastic soul"-styled "Lemon" and the low-key, Reed-ish quietude of ''''The First Time." But "Zooropa" is primarily a textural album, one where the background swirls and synth-blips that are spun into the sonic web by the production team of Eno, Flood and guitarist The Edge are as interesting as the action in the foreground -- the melody, Bono''s voice.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the latter, it''s not much there on the first single and video, ''''Numb," a brooding, pulsing electronic number with seemingly stream-of- consciousness lyrics written by The Edge. He delivers a series of negative commands in a relentless, detached monotone: "Don''t fill out any forms/Don''t compensate/ Don''t cover/Don''t crawl/Don''t come around late/Don''t hover at the gate." Bono enters midway with devilish, high-pitched aside: "I feel numb . . . too much is not enough." The spooky video adds another level or two -- submission, sex, black humor, with The Edge''s head slowly wrapped in rope. He''s tortured by water, teased and taunted by tongues and toes, but remains (dis)comfortably numb.\r\n\r\nOther left-field "Zooropa" entries include "Some Days Are Better Than Others" -- not a cheap beer ad slogan but a winsome, industrially based grinder that wrestles with emotional conflict -- and "Daddy''s Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car," which features cool polyrhythms, a comforting/disquieting musical framework and down-in-flames lyrical imagery. The most conventional song is "Babyface," a smooth-glider where the subversiveness is half-buried in the rolling rhythms and the soft, seductive melody. On "Zooropa," U2 climbs the rock mountain again, finds a different peak, likes it there -- and brings us to it.\r\n\r\nÂ© Copyright 2005 Globe Newspaper Company.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.boston.com/ae/music/packages/U2Fleetcenter/album_review_zooropa/', 'U2', 1, '2012-01-09 03:05:27', NULL, 2);
INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(26, 'Achtung Baby', '1992', 1, '"If you give a pop star a shit pile of dough and he refuses to self-destruct, I think it is a bit wet," said a smoking, slicked-back, black-sunglasses-clad Bono in a 1993 interview on the UK music show "Naked City". "I think it''s part of the deal. If they don''t die on a cross by 33, I''d ask for your money back." Like many of the knowingly audacious quotes from the singer and his U2 mates during this period, it''s a little tough to deduce the exact level of sincerity involved. And that was the whole idea. In the early 1990s, U2 were sending up the idea of a "rock''n''roll star." They were offering themselves as an ironic, postmodern band for similarly confused times. They were making fun of themselves and their own humorless, slate-faced 80s reputation. A year after Bono''s casual quip about pop stars dying on a cross, Kurt Cobain killed himself. And in Nirvana''s final video, for "Heart-Shaped Box", Cobain could be seen making wild eyes in front of one.\r\n\r\nAchtung Baby and its accompanying Zoo TV tour lived within the slippage between perception and reality. "Sometimes you can get far closer to the truth of what you''re trying to say by highlighting what it isn''t as if it were true," said the Edge on "Naked City". "That''s assuming we know the truth-- ''truth'' is one of those words that''s lost its meaning." In the 80s, U2 seemed endlessly in search of a definite truth, whether in peace or god or love or some ambiguous combination of the three. Famously, they didn''t find it.\r\n\r\nBut the quest was thrilling-- at least until 1988''s album and film Rattle and Hum, which found the group looking and sounding spectacularly self-serious while gawkily paying tribute to some of their American heroes like Elvis Presley and B.B. King. The resulting critical backlash caused these open-hearted Irishmen to reflect, and they weren''t crazy about what they saw in the mirror. "We looked like a big, overblown rock band running amok," says Bono in an excellent new documentary called From the Sky Down that chronicles the band''s pivotal turn-of-the-decade moment. And while that might seem like an aptly derisive opinion of today''s incarnation of U2, it''s important to remember that these guys originally came out of the cacophony of rule-breaking post-punk, a realm where bloated arena rock was the enemy. So they went away and tried to come up with a new way to seek some truth.\r\n\r\nAchtung Baby is rightly known as one of rock''s greatest reinventions because it was so complete. Sure, U2 changed their sound from chiming melodics to lurching, distorted rhythm. But they also changed their attitude, their demeanor, their look, their ideas on how to deal with celebrity. All of a sudden, they were funny, sexy, a bit dangerous-- three things few would''ve associated with U2 in the 80s. And yet, at their core, the band''s values remained constant. They were still ethically minded and interested in the real-life connection between living beings. But the way they went about projecting those core tenets flipped. In TV-news parlance, their attitude switched from "60 Minutes" to "The Colbert Report".\r\n\r\nThis new era was conveniently spelled-out on Achtung''s first single "The Fly" with the Edge''s metallic skronk and Bono''s conspiratorial, effected whisper of lines like, "It''s no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest/ It''s no secret that ambition bites the nails of success." And just as the album goes lengths to both fulfill and upend rock''n''roll myths with thorny tales of deep betrayal, questioned fidelity, and ambiguous artifice, this coffee-table-book sized, 6xCD, 4xDVD set both props up Achtung and pokes a few holes in it, too.\r\n\r\nTake the album''s much-ballyhooed place of origin, Berlin''s Hansa Studios. This was the location that played host to David Bowie and Iggy Pop''s electronic-inspired masterworks Low and The Idiot. And Hansa is located near the Berlin Wall, which had only recently been breached when U2 set up there in the fall of 1990. Perched literally in the middle of historic liberation, U2 were meant to find inspiration in the world events around them and turn that spark into a new version of the band for a new decade. It''s a great backdrop for a great story. But it didn''t really go down that way. "We''re there, and greatness has left the building," Bono recalls in From the Sky Down, which features the band returning to Hansa earlier this year in preparation for their headlining set at Glastonbury.\r\n\r\nWhile Berlin did inspire bits of the record-- "Zoo Station" was named after one of its prominent train terminals-- it hardly lived up to its lofty reputation. This serves as a lesson for U2, a band that shamelessly worships past rock heroes, to move past such naÃ¯ve mythologizing. "Berlin was a baptism of fire," says bassist Adam Clayton in the documentary. "It was something we had to go through to realize what we were trying to get to was not something you could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city-- that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." This newfound pragmatism would help them to move past their fantasies about the sanctity of rock. So while Berlin played a part on Achtung Baby, it did so in surprising ways; though "One" was mostly written in a burst of inspiration in Hansa, most of the album truly came together once the group went back home to Dublin.\r\n\r\nMost of the audio bonuses in this set are unfortunately superfluous, and don''t offer much in terms of insight. There are two CDs filled with dance remixes, and while U2 were at the vanguard of big time rock bands embracing the notion of the remix, even the most devout rave nostalgist would have little use for six remakes of "Mysterious Ways". The disc of bonus material and B-sides is disappointingly slight, and another filled with early versions of every song on Achtung offers a few revelations-- an Irish jig-style version of "Tryin'' to Throw Your Arms Around the World" has an easy charm, but generally, it''s easy to see why these attempts were improved upon later. Achtung''s even more electronic and weirder follow-up, 1993''s Zooropa-- which was recorded in a creative frenzy during a break in the Zoo TV tour-- is also included, though it''s generally (and somewhat unfairly) glossed over in all the accompanying materials.\r\n\r\nThe worthy additions in this "super deluxe edition" are nearly all visual. There''s Anton Corbijn''s gorgeous and colorful photography that covers its case, as well as a big, sturdy 84-page book. And then the four discs of video: It Might Get Loud director Davis Guggenheim''s new 90-minute doc From the Sky Down, every video from the era, a full live gig taped in Australia in 1993, interview shows (like "Naked City"), and, best of all, a playfully subversive TV special from 1992 that includes live footage from the Zoo TV tour as well as goofy interludes that play up the surrealism and insanity of the whole project. Moments like the "Even Better Than the Real Thing" video, with the band playing in a glass case while fans look on outside, successfully tie in all the pomo flourishes U2 were chasing. The group was at the forefront of bringing huge video screens into the live arena, and some of the tricks they pull off-- Bono "dueting" with a static-y Lou Reed or flipping channels to live local stations-- still look impressive. And for all the technical wizardry of the stage setup, the band still uses it to complement the music rather than overshadow it. Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band-- including U2 itself-- has been able to really expound upon in a meaningful way.\r\n\r\nIn the Zoo TV special, which originally aired during Thanksgiving weekend in 1992, a "news commentator" covering the show dubs it "the most significant and exciting TV event since the Gulf War." Some of the ideas behind Zoo TV and Achtung Baby were inspired by the television coverage of that initial Gulf War in 1991, and the bizarre reality of being able to switch channels from home shopping to MTV to the bombing of Baghdad. U2 recognized the dangers of this idea, when war turned into just more filler for the burgeoning 24-hour TV-news cycle. And instead of preaching against it in a high and mighty fashion, they embraced that chaos in an effort to expose it. Of course, our collective information overload has been upped exponentially since thanks to the internet, making the flashes of words and slogans that backed U2 during their live campaign seem eerily prophetic. Talking about the Zoo TV audience in the "Naked City" interview, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. says, "They''re coming to a rock''n''roll show and watching television, what more can you ask for?" He''s joking, but as we go to arenas and see singers on big screens through our cellphone cameras, the question begins to answer itself.\r\n\r\nSource: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16022-achtung-baby-super-deluxe-edition/', 'U2', 3, '2012-01-09 03:05:29', NULL, 2);
INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(27, 'Pop', '1997', 3, 'The Edge described Pop, rather disingenuously, as being, ''''about as far away from U2 as it is possible to be". This was strange considering that their last album, in collaboration with Brian Eno, had been the very un-U2 Passengers album. This was the point where, despite their epic status as world superstars, U2 were finally proven to have feet of clay.\r\n\r\nIt''s the sound of a band not reinventing themselves (as they did on Achtung Baby), but straining to keep up with the zeitgeist. In 1997 Britpop was on the wane, and dance music was now mainstream. The band employ Howie B, Steve Osborne and Flood to pep up some quite straightforward songs with loops, samples and bubbling synths. But despite the fairy dust they still have a somewhat dour heart.\r\n\r\nOpening single Discotheque may have had a jolly camp glitterball romp of a video, but the irony seemed forced. By Last Night On Earth and Gone the party mood''s soured and the other blast of fresh air: Mofo, has been forgotten. Closer, Wake Up Dead Man, may be the grimmest thing they ever committed to tape.\r\n\r\nThe number of singles released from Pop (six out of 12) just drove home the point that maybe U2 had strayed too far. Barely any of this material was used in subsequent gigs, and on their next studio outing they returned to what, after all, they knew best: pure stadium rock.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/dvn8', 'U2', 4, '2012-01-09 04:41:46', NULL, 1);
INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(28, 'Born This Way', '2011', 1, 'â€˜Hypeâ€™ is a disgusting word. But when an album, which was a self-declared phenomenon before it was even an album, appears to be an experiment in hype itself, it becomes an unavoidable part of the conversation. Thereâ€™s been a suspicion in the epic run-up to the release of Lady Gaga''s second-and-a-half album that sheâ€™s just been being deliberately ridiculous just to piss people off. But then, having a go at a pop star for being ridiculous is in itself as ridiculous as having a go at a brain surgeon for being too hung up on all the neurosurgery. \r\n\r\nThereâ€™s another possibility here though. In our man Peter Robinsonâ€™s (rather amazing) cover feature the other week, she expressed genuine surprise that people found â€˜Born This Wayâ€™ the song something of an â€˜Express Yourselfâ€™ parody. The suggestion actually moved her to tears. Itâ€™s in the nature of artists to miss the blindingly obvious about their own work. \r\n\r\nBut for the entire world to have the exact same instantaneous reaction, to the point where the words â€˜Express Yourselfâ€™ began trending on Twitter, suggests that comparison holds water. Youâ€™d think somebody â€“ somebody â€“ in her team could have noticed. Itâ€™s just possible that Gaga is now such a powerful entity that everybody was just too scared of losing their jobs to point it out. \r\n\r\nIt would certainly bear out the chain of events that led to that appalling, badly-photoshopped mess of a cover image getting signed off. And if thatâ€™s the case then we really are in new territory for mainstream pop music, where somebody at the absolute peak of commercial heaviosity is able to operate with the artistic imperative of a David Bowie without an iota of outside interference. What you definitely cannot fault about this album is the scale of its artistic ambition. \r\n\r\nOne thing that much-debated ''Born This Way'' album cover does get right is the recordâ€™s obsession with the fusion of flesh and metal. As if Gaga, having already (in her own head at least) fused herself with her fanbase to create a singular entity, she wants to weld physically to her synthesisers as if to create one all-powerful dreadnought of self-empowerment. For the most part this is one relentless torrent of heavy-metal-rave-pop. At the very least itâ€™s a triumph in sound engineering.\r\n\r\nâ€˜Hairâ€™ is an empowerment anthem using the simple image of the wind blowing through a personâ€™s hair to illuminate the albumâ€™s Love-Yourself-And-Let-It-All-Hang-Out message way more effectively than the title track. It trumps it once again by being quite the gayest thing you will ever hear for a long time. On the same tip is â€˜Bad Kidsâ€™, a homage to the NYC club kids era, hammering home the freak message to the Little Monsters, but with a chorus that is adorable instantly and forever. \r\n\r\nâ€˜Bloody Maryâ€™ is a serene flipside to â€˜Judasâ€™ this time using Ms Magdalene to do much the same job, as dainty plucked strings careen around filthy beats to create something weirdly graceful. And â€˜Americanoâ€™, a Hispanic upgrade of â€˜Alejandroâ€™ which riffs on both Evita and Santa Esmereldaâ€™s â€˜Donâ€™t Let Me Be Misunderstoodâ€™, succeeds because it is so colourfully deranged. Elsewhere the sci-fi goth night-stalk â€˜Electric Chapelâ€™ perhaps nails the recordâ€™s blood-and-chrome aesthetics most effectively of all.\r\n\r\nThings get rather knottier when the beats drop heavier. â€˜Schei?eâ€™, which channels Miss Kittin doing a rave take on Madonnaâ€™s â€˜Eroticaâ€™ strides into a commanding pop song and comes out a triumph. â€˜Government Hookerâ€™ drops down into freeform industrial techno impressively early on in the tracklist, but thereâ€™s scant evidence of any real political message in lines like â€œPut your hands on me, John F Kennedyâ€. And â€˜Heavy Metal Loverâ€™s staccato filth-fest is impressively murky but the relentless smut ends up sounding daft. The ostentatious â€˜Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)â€™ aims for some kind of weird chamber-rave-metal-concerto yet comes out a total mess.\r\n\r\nBut then at the end, something spectacular happens. Skynet is given a rest and it emerges again that when Gaga does do pure emotion, she does it exceptionally well. â€˜You And Iâ€™ is a quite epic exercise in futurist honky-tonk, apparently directed to a lesbian lover or a drag queen. And finally, the gleaming â€˜The Edge Of Gloryâ€™ (apparently a love song to her late grandfather, yet with a romantic twist) finds her dancing â€œOn the edge of something final we call life tonightâ€ in the most ecstatic pop serenade this woman has ever come up with. \r\n\r\nThat beautiful simplicity reminds us that Lady Gaga can be guilty of trying too hard. But do you really think thatâ€™s wrong? â€˜Born This Wayâ€™ doesnâ€™t get everything right. Itâ€™s not the clarion to the dispossessed that it thinks it is. And after pushing so hard in this direction, she should probably strip it back to just her and a piano next time if she really wants to shock. Because rather than an exercise in hype, what â€˜Born This Wayâ€™ really is an exercise in the pushing of everything to its ultimate degree. And for all the black, white and silver, it passes that test with flying colours.

INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(29, 'King of Limbs', '2011', 5, 'Radioheadâ€™s sense of timing is quite something. Just when it looks like Arcade Fire, on a high after victory at the Grammy and Brit awards, are set to become The Biggest Band In The World, the Oxford five-piece confirm that their eighth album isnâ€™t only done, but yours for a few bucks in mere seconds â€“ no need to get dressed, let alone leave the house. When it looks like teenage hip hop crew Odd Future are going to send Twitter into meltdown on the back of an alarming video, these old-timers position their own promo clip online, sit back and watch social networks collapse under the weight of a million thumbs-in-a-frenzy sorts expressing their adoration.\r\n\r\nTheir grasp of timing, in an arrangements-versus-attentions sense, is equally remarkable. Just as 2007â€™s In Rainbows shaved several minutes from the run-time of the preceding Hail to the Thief, so The King of Limbs cuts the(ir) full-length form down to a concise eight tracks and 37 minutes. Itâ€™s the bandâ€™s shortest-ever album, perfectly tuned to the listener of the 21st century â€“ perhaps more likely to listen to music on the way in or out of work, on a commute, than at their leisure with a nice glass of red. Of course, the digital distribution of the bandâ€™s previous LP was so successful that this set was sure to follow a similar release pattern â€“ something tangible will follow in March â€“ but this is a remarkably neat-and-tidy package. Perhaps it wasnâ€™t sequenced with succinctness in mind; but that it does its job in a short space of time is important.\r\n\r\nBecause if The King of Limbs dragged itsâ€¦ limbsâ€¦ for too much longer, the impression left might be very different. For five tracks this album unfolds in a manner very similar to In Rainbowsâ€™ memorable array of electro-chirrups and synth-sweeps, all glitches and groans where, a decade previous, Radiohead were very much A Guitar Band. The staggering, off-kilter step of opener Bloom might not click with those holding a candle for The Return of the Gallagher a week from this recordâ€™s release, but to anyone with even half an ear tuned to In Rainbows itâ€™ll seem very (although not over-) familiar indeed. Morning Mr Magpie plucks its way into a Foals-ian spin, the masters seemingly taking on board a few tips from their hometown pupils. Lotus Flower â€“ the source of #thomdance Twitter activity once its video was unveiled â€“ is another piece that looks backwards rather than projecting into bold, new sonic territories. It flails and flaps, but in a manner entirely in keeping with its makersâ€™ predilection for the metronomic â€“ to the wrong ears, itâ€™s five minutes of the same beat, utterly unremarkable.\r\n\r\nBut thatâ€™s the beauty of Radiohead â€“ theyâ€™ve never, certainly not since the breakthrough days of Creep, been a band for the people. Theyâ€™re too idiosyncratic for that, and even though there are moments aplenty here that suggest the band hasnâ€™t furthered their vision, subtle differences to a tested formula ensure The King of Limbs is another great album from Britainâ€™s most consistently brilliant band. And come Codex, it truly strikes the listener dumb. Like Motion Picture Soundtrack, Street Spirit, Sail to the Moon, Nude â€“ insert your own favourite slow-paced Radiohead numb-er here â€“ itâ€™s a piece of rarefied beauty. Thom says something about dragonflies, something else about nobody getting hurt; the words blur and blend, though, as beneath them the simplest, most strikingly gorgeous piano motif bores its way into the heart. And itâ€™s here, not any of your limited-character blogging or video-sharing sites, that Radiohead trump all comers, again.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/wd4z\r\n', 'Radiohead', 7, '2012-01-09 03:05:35', NULL, 2);
INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(30, 'In Rainbows', '2007', 4, 'Like many music lovers of a certain age, I have a lot of warm memories tied up with release days. I miss the simple ritual of making time to buy a record. I also miss listening to something special for the first time and imagining, against reason, the rest of the world holed up in their respective bedrooms, having the same experience. Before last Wednesday, I can''t remember the last time I had that feeling. I also can''t remember the last time I woke up voluntarily at 6 a.m. either, but like hundreds of thousands of other people around the world, there I was, sat at my computer, headphones on, groggy, but awake, and hitting play.\r\n\r\nSuch a return to communal exchange isn''t something you''d expect to be orchestrated by a band who''s wrung beauty from alienation for more than a decade. But if the past few weeks have taught us anything, it''s that Radiohead revel, above all else, in playing against type. It''s written in their discography; excluding the conjoined twins that were Kid A and Amnesiac, each of their albums constitutes a heroic effort to debunk those that came before it. Although 2003''s Hail to the Thief was overlong and scattershot, it was important insofar as it represented the full band''s full-circle digestion and synthesis of the sounds and methods they first toyed with on OK Computer. So, after a decade of progression, where do we go from here?\r\n\r\nIf the 2006 live renditions of their new material were anything to go by, not much further. With few exceptions, the roughly 15 songs introduced during last year''s tour gave the impression that after five searching records, Radiohead had grown tired of trying to outrun themselves. Taken as a whole, the guitar-centric compositions offered a portrait of a band who, whether subconsciously or not, looked conciliatory for the first time in its career. Although a wonderful surprise, their early October album announcement only lent further credence to the theory. Where they''d previously had the confidence to precede albums like OK Computer and Kid A with marketing fanfare worthy of a classic-in-making, this sneak attack felt like a canny strategy to prepare fans for an inevitable downshift.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant In Rainbows represents no such thing. Nonetheless, it''s a very different kind of Radiohead record. Liberated from their self-imposed pressure to innovate, they sound-- for the first time in ages-- user-friendly; the glacial distance that characterized their previous records melted away by dollops of reverb, strings, and melody. From the inclusion and faithful rendering of longtime fan favorite "Nude" to the classic pop string accents on "Faust Arp" to the uncharacteristically relaxed "House of Cards", Radiohead''s sudden willingness to embrace their capacity for uncomplicated beauty might be In Rainbows'' most distinguishing quality, and one of the primary reasons it''s an improvement on Hail to the Thief.\r\n\r\nNow that singer Thom Yorke has kickstarted a solo career-- providing a separate venue for the solo electronic material he used to shoehorn onto Radiohead albums-- Radiohead also sound like a full band again. Opener "15 Step"''s mulched-up drum intro represents the album''s only dip into Kid A-style electronics; from the moment Jonny Greenwood''s zestful guitar line takes over about 40 seconds in, In Rainbows becomes resolutely a five-man show. (For all of Yorke''s lonely experimental pieces, it''s easy to forget how remarkably the band play off each other; the rhythm section of Phil Selway and Colin Greenwood are especially incredible, supplying between them for a goldmine of one-off fills, accents, and runs over the course of the record.) A cut-up in the spirit of "Airbag"-- albeit with a jazzier, more fluid guitar line-- "15 Step" gives way to "Bodysnatchers", which, like much of In Rainbows, eschews verse/chorus/verse structure in favor of a gradual build. Structured around a sludgy riff, it skronks along noisily until about the two-minute mark, when the band veers left with a sudden acoustic interlude. By now, Radiohead are experts at tearing into the fabric of their own songs for added effect, and In Rainbows is awash in those moments.\r\n\r\nThe band''s big-hearted resurrection of "Nude" follows. The subject of fervent speculation for more than a decade, its keening melodies and immutable prettiness had left it languishing behind Kid A''s front door. Despite seeming ambivalent about the song even after resurrecting it for last year''s tour, this album version finds Yorke wrenching as much sweetness out of it as he possibly can, in turn giving us our first indication that he''s in generous spirits. Another fan favorite, "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi" brandishes new drums behind its drain-circling arpeggios, but sounds every bit as massive in crescendoing as its live renditions suggested it might. "All I Need", meanwhile, concludes the album''s first side by dressing up what begins as a skeletal rhythm section in cavernous swaths of glockenspiel, synths, pianos, and white noise.\r\n\r\nWith its fingerpicked acoustic guitars and syrupy strings, "Faust Arp" begs comparisons to some of the Beatles'' sweetest two-minute interludes, while the stunning "Reckoner" takes care of any lingering doubt about Radiohead''s softer frame of mind: Once a violent rocker worthy of its title, this version finds Yorke''s slinky, elongated falsetto backed by frosty, clanging percussion and a meandering guitar line, onto which the band pile a chorus of backing harmonies, pianos, and-- again-- swooping strings. It may not be the most immediate track on the album, but over the course of several listens, it reveals itself to be among the most woozily beautiful things the band has ever recorded.\r\n\r\nWith its lethargic, chipped-at guitar chords, "House of Cards" is a slow, R.E.M.-shaped ballad pulled under by waves of reverbed feedback. While it''s arguably the one weak link in the album''s chain, it provides a perfect lead-in to the spry guitar workout of "Jigsaw Falling Into Place". Like "Bodysnatchers" and "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi" before it, "Jigsaw" begins briskly and builds into a breakneck conclusion, this time with Yorke upshifting from low to high register to supply a breathless closing rant.\r\n\r\nFinally, the closer. Another fan favorite, Yorke''s solo versions of "Videotape" suggested another "Pyramid Song" in the making. Given the spirit of In Rainbows, you''d be forgiven for assuming its studio counterpart might comprise some sort of epic finale, but to the disappointment of fans, it wasn''t to be. Instead, we get a circling piano coda and a bassline that seems to promise a climax that never comes. "This is one for the good days/ And I have it all here on red, blue, green," Yorke sings. It''s an affecting sentiment that conjures up images of the lead singer, now a father of two, home filming his kids. A rickety drum beat and shuddering percussions work against the melody, trying clumsily to throw it off, but Yorke sings against it: "You are my center when I spin away/ Out of control on videotape."\r\n\r\nAs the real life drums give way to a barely distinguishable electronic counterpart, Yorke trails off, his piano gently uncoils, and the song ends with a whimper. The whole thing is an extended metaphor, of course, and, this being Radiohead, it''s heavy-handed in its way, but it''s also a fitting close to such a human album. In the end, that which we feared came true: In Rainbows represents the sound of Radiohead coming back to earth. Luckily, as it turns out, that''s nothing to be afraid of at all.\r\n\r\nSource: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10785-in-rainbows/', 'Radiohead', 8, '2012-01-09 04:41:45', NULL, 1);

Many of you probably became sick of all the incredible hype weeks ago. Those lucky few who''ve been listening to Hail To The Thief, by fair means or foul, have been ranting and raving for weeks. Annoying the rest of us who have to (or want to) wait until the official release date. They''ve been foaming at the mouth with excitement; "The Saviours of Rock ''n'' Roll return with best album in the world ever!!" and such like. But is it justified?\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I loved OK Computer but was alienated by Kid A and didn''t really get into Amnesiac for one reason or another. Hail To The Thief is without question more accessible than its two predecessors. But to say it''s a step backwards or disappointing in any way is foolish.\r\n\r\nRadiohead, the most popular innovative band on the planet, haven''t broken any new ground here, as they did with Kid A. This album sees a return to simple song construction. Guitar, drums and keyboards form the backbone of these 14 indie pop songs.\r\n\r\n"Go To Sleep" and "Where I End and You Begin" are fantastic. Driving guitars attack from all sides, demanding your attention, juddering with impressive force. Yorke''s vocals are in fine form here; melancholic and hypnotic.\r\n"A Punchup At A Wedding" is sublime. The song rolls effortlessly along taking the listener on a serene journey which also provides subtle amusement along the way: ''You had to piss on our parade, you had to shred our big day...in a drunken punch up at a wedding''.\r\n\r\nThere are still the wonderfully eerie sounds ("The Gloaming") and the computerised electronic bleeps ("Sit Down, Stand Up"). These songs provide evidence that Radiohead are still capable of producing ambitious music which is remarkably enjoyable.\r\n\r\nCurrent single "There There" is number four in the charts and the album is about to set up residence at number 1. How do Radiohead maintain their position as the world''s most successful, non-mainstream band? Is it because Thom Yorke rarely smiles? And doesn''t have a celebrity girlfriend? I suspect it''s because they make some of the most amazing, anthemic, inspiring music around today.\r\n\r\nAll Hail Radiohead.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/wfxm', 'Radiohead', 9, '2012-01-09 03:05:37', NULL, 2);

Similarly, they seem to feel no tremendous loyalty to the original if they feel like shaking it up a bit. \r\n\r\nNo one seems more relaxed than Jones, who splits lead vocal chores with Julian (who sounds a lot like Lyle Lovett). With the weight of carrying the entire project off her shoulders, Jones delivers knock-out performances whether itâ€™s singing lead on the lovely â€œRemember Meâ€ or on the feisty â€œ Fist City.â€\r\n\r\nSome of the best moments are where Julian takes the lead and Jones is very content to play second fiddle, such as on the lively, chugging remake of Johnny Cashâ€™s â€œWide Open Roadâ€ or on the mid-tempo â€œLovesick Blues,â€ where Jonesâ€™ harmonies wrap around Julianâ€™s voice like a warm fire on a cold night.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, thereâ€™s a confidence the pickers display that lets them be quiet and allow the lyrics to sink in, such as on the Willie Nelson-penned â€œPermanently Lonely,â€ which is quietly devastating in its damnation of a callous lover. There is, thankfully, no attempt to gussy up the arrangements with modern technology and the production is crystal clear on every song, especially highlighting Rieserâ€™s powerful, yet understated drumming, and Campilongoâ€™s dazzling, but never show-offy, guitar work.  The one original, Campilongoâ€™s largely instrumental â€œTommy Rockwood,â€ fits right in.\r\n\r\nThough fans of Jonesâ€™ jazzy solo albums may find The Little Willies a tad too twangy for their taste,  fans of great musicianship will find plenty to enjoy on â€œFor The Good Times.â€ \r\n\r\nSource: http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/the-beat-goes-on/posts/album-review-the-little-willies-featuring-norah-jones-soar-on-sophomore-set', 'Nora Jones', 4, '2012-01-09 02:31:58', NULL, 2);
INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(33, 'The Fall', '2009', 2, 'Norah Jones always seemed almost unfairly equipped to survive the inexorable attrition that mows down legions of her fellow female singer-songwriters: young (23 at the release of her 2002 debut, Come Away With Me), beautiful, possessed of a lovely husky drawl and an appealingly picturesque back-story (Ravi Shankar is by now resigned to being recalled principally as Jonesâ€™ father, rather than as the worldâ€™s best-known sitarist). Jones didnâ€™t merely survive, of course â€“ her three albums to date have shifted 36 million copies. In todayâ€™s climate, that seems as miraculous and unfathomable as a seeing someone walking a brachiosaurus.\r\n\r\nIn this context, it would be easy to be cynical about this fourth album. To the limited extent that it has hitherto been possible to object to Jones, it has been on the grounds that she errs towards the inoffensive â€“ or, more bluntly, that her sensationally profitable records are duller than the side-salads at the dinner parties for which they serve as soundtracks. The Fall seems a carefully plotted attempt to confront this reputation for cosiness. Ryan Adams and Okkervill Riverâ€™ s Will Sheff are recruited as collaborators, and Marc Ribot â€“ best known for his fraught guitar-playing with Tom Waits â€“ is enlisted in the backing band.\r\n\r\nThe result, at the risk of damning with faint praise, is Jonesâ€™ most interesting album â€“ but it is, like its predecessors, a martyr to her overweening tastefulness. The Adams collaboration, Light as a Feather, tries nervously to be a Mazzy Star-style torch ballad, pawing the line between intimacy and claustrophobia, but Jones sighs where she should seethe. Stuck, co-written with Sheff, should sound driven to distraction, but instead sounds merely distracted. Her own compositions suffer similarly: Itâ€™s Gonna Be is a Glitter Band stomp done tiptoe, Youâ€™ve Ruined Me a country-ish waltz oozing none of the blood and tears that soak the best of the genre. Itâ€™s only on the ruthlessly realistic wishlist Man of the Hour that she seems to relax: itâ€™s both affecting and gently hilarious, and her best vocal on the album.\r\n\r\nJonesâ€™ inherent languor has wrought marvels â€“ the version of Hank Williamsâ€™ Cold, Cold Heart on Come Away With Me and the reading of Townes Van Zandtâ€™s Be Here To Love Me on 2004â€™s Feels Like Home both benefited from their counter-intuitive coolness. Not for the first time, though, an albumâ€™s worth of Jonesâ€™ luxuriance is somewhat rough going.\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/8n5c', 'Norah Jones', 4, '2012-01-09 20:30:32', NULL, 2);
INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(34, 'Plastic Beach', '2009', 1, 'Forget the cartoon characters. Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett''s animated misfits have always been mainly interesting as a concept, and on much of the third Gorillaz album, Plastic Beach, it feels like Albarn and co. are ditching the idea of writing pop songs a cartoon band might front anyway. The one-time Blur frontman has transcended some of the post-modern artifice of this project, and created the group''s most affecting and uniquely inviting album. Joke''s over, Gorillaz are real.\r\n\r\nSo why make this a Gorillaz album in the first place? It wasn''t meant to be one. Hewlett, the celebrated Tank Girl co-creator, told The Observer last July, "Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters anymore-- it''s more like an organization of people doing new projects." The project was to be called Carousel, presented by, but not performed by, Gorillaz. It never panned out. So Albarn devised Plastic Beach, a loose enviromental-song cycle warning against disposability. It''s a noble conceit, if a transient one.\r\n\r\nAlong with a typically diverse band of collaborators, Albarn dips into Krautrock, funk, and dubstep, as well as the weary, more melodic music he''s been perfecting for much of last decade-- sort of an electronic take on baroque pop. Albarn also sounds more comfortable as a leader here than he has in some time. On the standout "On Melancholy Hill", he recalls the swooning strains of one of his heroes, Scott Walker. And when he shares or cedes vocals, he has the good sense to turn things over to luminaries like Lou Reed (magnificently dry-throated on "Some Kind of Nature") and Bobby Womack (good on first single "Stylo", better on the twangy "Cloud of Unknowing"), while effortlessly integrating them into the sound.\r\n\r\nHandling most of the production himself, Albarn has reversed the good fortune of the first two Gorillaz albums. With Dan the Automator on their 2001 self-titled debut and Danger Mouse on 2005''s Demon Days, the group was adept at fusing giddy pop with hip-hop, inserting De La Soul, Del the Funky Homosapien, or a yippy Miho Hatori into some of their best songs ("Clint Eastwood", "Dirty Harry", "Feel Good Inc.", "19-2000"). Those songs crashed in from all places with little mind to sequence or balance, and the result was two fairly unfocused records saved by some decent alt-rap.\r\n\r\nOn Plastic Beach, things are the other way around. The rap moments here feel almost needlessly idiosyncratic amidst the lusher treatments. Snoop Dogg''s appearance on "Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach" is an incongruous introduction to an album that has nothing to do with Snoop Dogg. De La repeat themselves on the faux jingle "Superfast Jellyfish". Grime MCs Kano and Bashy compellingly play pass-the-baton on "White Flag", but only after disrupting an absorbing intro and outro by the Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. Only on "Sweepstakes" is Mos Def able to assimilate into the production.\r\n\r\nAlbarn is more natural when working in the kind of ornate Village Green Preservation Society-style pop that dominates Plastic Beach. His collaborations with Little Dragon, "Empire Ants" and "To Binge" are two of the most arresting things here-- they''re airy, elusive, and amazingly beautiful. It''s been years since Albarn has written anything as blatantly gorgeous. If he had to work past the animated pretense to rediscover it, all the better. Why be a cartoon when you can be a real person?\r\n\r\nSource: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14008-plastic-beach/', 'Gorillaz', 4, '2012-01-09 18:45:59', NULL, 2);
INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(35, 'Bestival Live 2011', '2011', 3, 'The Cure are nearly three-and-a-half decades deep in the game and have never been shy about monetizing their seemingly boundless recorded output. So it''s something of a surprise that Bestival 2011 is their first official live record since the double-shot of 1993''s Paris and Show, which capitalized on Wish boosting the band to its commercial zenith. The Cure have kept busier than a band of its status has needed to since then, releasing four studio records, a second greatest hits collection, and an intimidating, comprehensive B-sides collection, while Robert Smith parlayed his godfather status into guest spots on Blink-182 and Crystal Castles singles. But these things are often as novel as their setlist, and Bestival''s intentions could not be clearer, accounting for the Cure''s existence between 1993 and 2011 with a grand total of 10 minutes of music.\r\n\r\nThen again, in a setting such as this one, fans who paid a couple days'' salary for festival tickets like to have their preconceptions confirmed. Since Paris and Show, that''s a one-hot-album-every-18-year average-- and I say that aware that a lot of people don''t even have an abnormally generous relationship with Bloodflowers like I do. But even if the Cure''s discography is riddled with redundancies, the question becomes: Who is Bestival even for? Particularly if completists almost certainly own Show and Paris, and newcomers to the band can (and often do) start with Staring at the Sea?\r\n\r\nWithout a visual accompaniment, Bestival is best viewed as a testament to the Cure''s longevity and stylistic breadth. But while the collection speaks highly of the Cure''s professionalism, it never catches spark, save for a performance of "The Caterpillar", reportedly their first since 1984. And since each song sticks so closely to the script, there''s never much development of an internal narrative to make this performance seem worthy of documentation, though you could let your ears go soft and see it as a sort of Benjamin Button effect where they scale from their most regal and sumptuous ("Plainsong", "Open") to the wiry punk of the Three Imaginary Boys cuts that close out the set.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, their professionalism extends to the actual recording-- the sound is crisp and clear, and even Smith''s stage banter sounds remotely intelligible. His voice has aged astoundingly well, all the more impressive for how it maintains such a startling fidelity to its studio counterpart, no matter if he''s straining desperately on the atomically negative "One Hundred Years" or purring the come-ons of "Lullaby". Yet that clinical treatment robs the Cure''s more expansive numbers ("Disintegration", "Push") of atmosphere and oddly minimizes them in open space, Smith''s passionate guitar work just sounding kinda weedy. And often the loudest element of the mix is this Tupperware-snap snare that haunts anyone who''s been within earshot of a hi-fi Dave Matthews Band bootleg.\r\n\r\nNot to mention the times when the professionalism works against the intent of the material. Even if there was always something arena-rock about "Shake Dog Shake", it''s rendered toothless when stripped of the circumstantial psychosis from The Top''s sessions, and while they can''t not play "Boys Don''t Cry", it''s performed at a flat-footed "we''re gettin'' too old for this shit" pace. Meanwhile, sticking "The End of the World" and "The Only One" amongst "A Night Like This" and "Lovesong" as if they''re every bit as part of the firmament is surely a noble attempt at revisionist history.\r\n\r\nBut man, if you really want revisionist history, get to the end of this thing. Now, especially as it comes at the tail end of a two-hour peformance, the spirited, charged-up instrumental passages of this track are inspiring. But then Smith gets to the chorus and yelps, "I am the stranger... KILLING ANOTHER." I thought my promo copy had a typo, or it was a situation similar to when you could find copies of In Utero in retail stores with "Waif Me". "Killing an Arab" was misinterpreted by the same people Smith lashed out against on Cure''s very embarrassing political rant "Us or Them" as being racially insensitive post-9/11, but it''s just profoundly depressing to hear the song rendered all but completely meaningless when the mass setting should make it all the more resonant.\r\n\r\nWhich is really the dynamic that''s confusing about Bestival-- it''s easy to enough to understand the thrill of hearing "Friday I''m in Love" or "Just Like Heaven" amidst tens of thousands, but at this point, the Cure feel like less of a band than a traveling museum or theme park celebrating their past with the occasional new exhibit or ride to stoke interest. In other words, a completely user-driven experience en masse: You want to remember them as minimalist, ghostly post-punkers? They''re touring Seventeen Seconds and Faith in the "Don''t Look Back" format. If you prefer your mopes to be more drawn-out and reverberant, there''s the Trilogy DVD where they play Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers in their exact order, exactly as they''re played on record (its replay value is exactly what you''d expect). As for Bestival? It''s what I suppose is a great reminder about the vastness of the Cure''s actual catalog and their real-time vitality as a band as opposed to merely their influence, but even two hours of their best stuff in this format feels less rewarding than spending 20 minutes cobbling together your own Spotify playlist. After all, the corollary to the Cure-as-a-business is that the customer''s always right.\r\n\r\nSource: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16120-bestival-2011/?utm_campaign=most-read-week&utm_medium=related&utm_source=pitchfork', 'The Cure', 5, '2012-01-09 04:42:01', NULL, 1);
INSERT INTO `albums` VALUES(36, 'Disintegration [Deluxe Edition] ', '2010', 1, 'The late 1980s and early 90s were the Cure''s heyday-- from an American perspective. It''s not just that they were making great music; they''d been making great music for roughly a decade already. But these were the years during which they coalesced into this whole iconic thing, the Cure-- a sound, a look, and a sensibility that a few kids in every other high school could build whole identities around. Or at least whole wardrobes, decoration schemes, and notebook scribbles. One of my first big memories of listening to Disintegration involves wandering around the Colorado State Fair, from the agriculture show to the gang fights by the midway. This is a kind of reach I doubt Robert Smith ever imagined.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there they were. You could say-- again, from an American perspective-- that it started with two things. There was Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, a 1987 double album that scatters in a lot of different directions. This is something the band always did well: listening to their "many moods" pop records is like exploring a new city, where every storefront and side street offers something unique. The same went for Standing on a Beach / Staring at the Sea, a collection of singles stretching from 1978 to 1985, that was critical to introducing this band to North Americans.\r\n\r\nBut mostly there was Disintegration: the record where Robert Smith approached turning 30, got engaged and then married, got annoyed with the way his band was working, and went off by himself to write something deep and serious. Disintegration does not "scatter." It''s a single, grand, dense, continual, epic trip into core stuff the Cure did well. They''d always been good at this kind of album, too. If Kiss Me is a crowded, teeming city to explore, listening to Disintegration is more like standing in the middle of some vast, empty space-- the kind of ocean or plain where you can see the horizon in all directions. You can sense that focus straight from the first minute, during which some wind chimes knock around in an empty void, and then the band bursts out with one of the most overwhelmingly grand openings I ''ve ever heard on a pop record-- a slow-motion, radiant synth figure of such scale that Sofia Coppola has plausibly used it to soundtrack the coronation of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nIt''s no wonder this was meaningful to a lot of teenagers: The sheer emotional grandeur of tracks like that opener, "Plainsong", make a great match for the feeling that everything in your life is all-consumingly important, whether it''s your all-consuming sadness, joy, longing, or whatever. And yet Disintegration is not a very teenagey album. It''s not an emo whine, and it''s not a big miserablist mope, either; one of its most popular tracks, "Lovesong", was written by Smith as a wedding present for his wife. "I will always love you," it keeps promising-- not the way you sing that in a giddy love song, but like it''s a grave, solemn, bloody commitment. It was a top 10 hit in the U.S.\r\n\r\nThis is the thing: The album has a reputation as some huge, dark, crushingly depressive experience. It''s not entirely unearned. If you want to be crushingly depressed with Disintegration, or frustrated, or self-loathing, it''ll embrace you right back. But it''ll embrace other things, too. A whole lot of this album''s appeal is that it''s comforting, practically womblike-- big, warm, slow, full of beauty and melody and even joy. The trick, I think, is how well it serves as a soundtrack to that feeling that everything around you is meaningful, whether it''s beautiful or horrible or sublime: This is an album for capital-R Romantics, not sulkers. It''s muscular (like on the title track), wistful ("Pictures of You"), ghostly ("Closedown"), seething ("Fascination Street"), and yeah, morose, but what''s striking is how each of those qualities can reach really, really far into your gut. It''s not a record for the dead-inside: Get far enough into this album, and I will almost guarantee you will feel some shit.\r\n\r\nIt''s monolithic, and most of the songs work the same way. A lot of them are mostly "intro": The steady pulse of bass and guitar underneath, while glacially huge synth lines and liquid guitar melodies sparkle through the foreground. After a while, Smith''s voice comes in, echoing calmly, surveying the ocean around him. On Kiss Me he yowled and croaked and had fun with it, but he spends the length of this album turning in tense, restrained performances, calm and steely and grave. The parts where he actually lets loose and starts raving are explosive. The title track, for instance, plunges further and further into a frustrated wail before climaxing on one phrase: "Both of us knew/ How the end always is." (You can take that climax as harrowing or cathartic or just plain fun.) Songs like this aren''t organized around parts and movements, just steady repetition and emotional build. So at some point you realize that the intros aren''t really "intros," not just a period of waiting for things to start: sinking into the sound of this album-- a sound whose every element feels huge and magnificent-- is the whole point.\r\n\r\nAnd that, to be honest, is the one drawback of this reissue. If I''m remembering correctly, the first pressings of Disintegration actually said, in the liner notes, "this album was mixed to be played loud, so turn it up." It was intentionally created with headroom to spare, and designed to be full of space-- every instrument surrounded by air, every echo trail clear and audible, an album that was above all comfortable to listen to. Like most remasters these days, this one has to pump up the volume toward modern levels, which means smushing things together and making parts fight for space. I''m not so cranky that this usually bothers me, but this is one album where it might really eat away at the point-- those horizons you used to be able to see in all directions have been moved miles closer.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, there''s the rest of the package. Previous reissues in this series have included home demos that felt more like curiosities than anything useful. But the ones here are enlightening; it''s marvelous to hear them and consider how Smith''s instrumental sketches came together into anything as complete as this record. (You can also chuckle at the cheery-sounding ones that obviously got axed along the way.) With this package, in fact, you can go from home demos to studio ones, from studio demos to the album, and then from the album to the third disc-- 1989 live recordings of each track, in order. And where are these "crushingly depressive" ghouls playing them? At Wembley Arena, in front of more than 10,000 people.\r\n\r\nSource: http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/?utm_campaign=album_reviews&utm_medium=site&utm_source=related', 'The Cure', 5, '2012-01-15 17:13:53', NULL, 2);
